        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Tom from Birmingham. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, rock climbing & video games.</p>
        <p>I got into coding after some exposure in my job working with rents and service charges. I loved the problem solving and logical aspects as well as the idea of learning a new skill. After some self learning I settled on joining Manchester codes to accelerate my move into a tech based career.</p>
